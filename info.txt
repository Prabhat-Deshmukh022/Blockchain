Mixers -

Q-1:    What are Mixers?
A:      Mixers are services which are primarily used to provide privacy in cryptocurrency transactions

Q-2:    How do they work?
A:      Mixers, as the name suggest, mix information and amounts from various different transactions and provide the end 
        output as a result of "mixing" amounts from different transactions. These groups of transactions which are involved
        in mixing together can be called "tumblers".

This helps in obfuscating the original sender's identity.

Q-3    Why are we decoding mixers?
A:     The mixing services provide a final transaction id by mixing various other transactions in the tumbler, in some cases,
       the mixing service may extort or claim some of the cryptocurrency, and there would be no way to identify and trace it back
       because of the mixing mechanism.

Q-4    How are we decoding mixers?
A:     We start out with a bunch of transactions, which we call as seed transactions. We follow these transactions into the tumbler
       that they will be used in, and color all the other transactions involved there, these are called anonimity sets.

       We follow these transactions further to identify more anonimity sets, by coloring other tumblers which take the initial ones
       as input, we also color other inputs to the same tumbler.

       In this process, we can identify a pattern
